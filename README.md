### Detecting COVID-19 From Chest X-Ray Images using CNN
This project aims to develop and implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, creating a precise and efficient model that can significantly contribute to the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, thereby facilitating effective patient management and curbing the transmission of the disease.
<p>By training a CNN model on a large dataset of chest X-ray images, consisting of COVID-19-positive and negative cases, we seek to establish a reliable and efficient method for COVID-19 detection. The trained model will be able to classify new chest X-ray images as either COVID-19-positive or negative, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions.</p>
